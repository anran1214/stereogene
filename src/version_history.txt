=========== Version 1.43 =================
1. Previous version has a limit on the chromosome number - 300. 1.43 has not such limit.
2. Files with distance distributions *.fgCorr and *.bgCorr are replaced by single file *.dist
3. Flag definition Distances=<0|1> is replaced by Distances=<TOTAL | DETAIL | NONE>: 
   In the first case <TOTAL> the file *.dist will contain fields: 
   	   x - distance
	   Bg - background correlation function
	   Fg - foreground correlation function
	   FgPlus - foreground correlation function for the positive windows
	   FgMinus - foreground correlation function for the negative windows
   In the second case <DETAIL> the file *.dist will contain additional fields with the distance distribution for every chromosome separately.
4. The chromosome statistics file can be created.
5. Cumulative file Statistics changed. It contains now additional fields with average and standard deviations of foreground and background distributions.

========== Version 1.44 ====================
1. Fixed error in output files (segment boundaries are now defined as end=beg+window_length)
2. Active module is removed from the StereoGene main program
3. local correlation can be calculated as f\int g\rho + g\int f\rho and as \int g\rho*\int f\rho (see parameter outWig)
4. Active is implemented as a separate program.

========== Version 1.45 ====================
1. Fixed an memory allocation error.
2. Fixed error with list file location. Now file list can be located in 'files' directory
========== Version 1.46 ====================
1. in the cfg-file the boolean Flags now can be defined as YES/NO or ON/OFF
2. the 'verbose' parameter can be defined in the cfg-file
3. the Program generates a WARNING message if unknown parameter appears.
========== Version 1.47 ====================
1. Now the program analyses modification time of track and profile. If the track file has more resent time than a profile file the preparation stage will be done.
2. The NA flag is used on preparation step
========== Version 1.48 ====================
1. Fixed bug in trackPrepare (read wig-files). The previous versions write a parasite data to the profile. As result a periodic small peaks appears.
========== Version 1.50 ====================
1. A new parameter introduced: kernelNS. This is percent for reducing kernel values in the interval [-15..+150]bp: newVal=oldVal*(1-kernelNS/100).
2. A new out-file statistics.xml.  
========== Version 1.51 ====================
1. Fixed bug in local correlation wig-file 
2. Local correlation wig file uses log scale 
========== Version 1.52 ====================
1. Fixed bug in auto-correlation function
========== Version 1.53 ====================
1. Changed scale in outWIG
========== Version 1.54 ====================
1. Makefile. If you have problems with ccvars, replace it with ccvars.simple
========== Version 1.55 ====================
1. Fixed bud with loss of last chromosom
2. Alloud blank lines in chrom length file
========== Version 1.56 ====================
1. Fixed bug in read chromosomes
========== Version 1.57 ====================
1. Program reads cfg from program directory, then from current working directory, then from args
2. Program creates necessary directories
3. Program parse tilda at the beginning of filename
4. Program allows spaces in filenames / directory names
