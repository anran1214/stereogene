1. Previuos veriosn has limit on the chromosome number - 300. 1.43 has not such limit.
2. Files with distance distributions *.fgCorr and *.bgCorr are replaced by single file *.dist
3. Flag defeinition Distances=<0|1> is replased by Distances=<TOTAL | DETAIL | NONE>: 
   In the first case <TOTAL> the file *.dist will contain fields: 
   	   x - distance
	   Bg - background correlation function
	   Fg - foreground correlation function
	   FgPlus - foreground correlation function for the positive windows
	   FgMinus - foreground correlation function for the negative windows
   In the second case <DETAIL> the file *.dist will contain additional fields with the distance distribution for every chromosome separately.
4. The chromosome statistics file can be created.
5. Cummulative file Statistics changed. It contains now additional fields with average and standard deviations of foreground and background distributions.
